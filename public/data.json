And somtething that I love too is to make tasks the easiest possible, that's why I choose my career and that is my favorite part about it. Actually, I'm currently working at Bradescard Mexico as Analytics Intern (since I don't have enough time to a full time job), my daily tasks are things like automate processes, reports creation and in fact, making boring tasks easier to my partners. : )",
